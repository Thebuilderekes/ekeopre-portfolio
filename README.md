# ekeopre-portfolio
##Description
This is my official portfolio website. It was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript library called anime js and GSAP. It will change over time as I add/remove projects and tweak the layout and design.

###Idea behind the project
My intention was to keep the design as simple and clear as possible while still looking attractive. I maintained minimal usage of colours and avoided distraction by using minimal design elements.
