# ekeopre-portfolio
##Description
This is my official portfolio website. It was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript library called animate.css and GSAP. It will evolve over time as I add/remove projects and tweak the layout and design.

###Idea behind the project
My intention was to keep the design as simple and clear as possible while still looking attractive. I maintained minimal usage of colours and avoided too much distraction by using minimal design elements and animations.
